	Added some features to AVC and MiniAVC

		AVC

		Added Compatibility Override incl. GUI
		Added Update Frequency
		Added command line flag to write just a separate AVC.log
		MiniAVC

		-Added Update Frequency

		Compatibility Override
		Allows to set a single addon or a range of versions to be compatible with a different KSP version, configurable via GUI.
		GUI becomes available after all addons have been checked for updates. Can be accessed via a button in the dropdown addon list or by pressing "modkey + 2".
		Mod authors can disallow the override for their mod by adding <"DISALLOW_VERSION_OVERRIDE": true> to the .version file.
		Update notifications are not affected!

		Update Frequency
		Allows to skip AVC version check for a some time or to disable it at all. Configurable via config file:

		"-1" to disable AVC
		"0" to run at each game launch (default)
		"x > 0" skip AVC for the next x hours
		Logging
		Prevent AVC to write into the KSP.log and output_log by adding the command line parameter "-AVC-log-only".
