1.1.6.5
KSP-AVC/AddonInfo

	Add code to ensure that the Min/max are both there, and that they override the KSPVersion if it is there
		Added Min/Max functions to VersionInfo
		Added FixMissingMinMax after parsing files

		if KSP_VERSION is outside the bounds of KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX, it will be replaced with the appropriate one.  
		If only one of the KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX are specified and KSP_VERSION is specified, then the missing parameter 
		will be set to either the appropriate min/max against  KSP_VERSION

	Disabled the remote overriding local if the versions were identical

		MiniAVC

		-Added Update Frequency

		Compatibility Override
		Allows to set a single addon or a range of versions to be compatible with a different KSP version, configurable via GUI.
		GUI becomes available after all addons have been checked for updates. Can be accessed via a button in the dropdown addon list or by pressing "modkey + 2".
		Mod authors can disallow the override for their mod by adding <"DISALLOW_VERSION_OVERRIDE": true> to the .version file.
		Update notifications are not affected!

		Update Frequency
		Allows to skip AVC version check for a some time or to disable it at all. Configurable via config file:

		"-1" to disable AVC
		"0" to run at each game launch (default)
		"x > 0" skip AVC for the next x hours
		Logging
		Prevent AVC to write into the KSP.log and output_log by adding the command line parameter "-AVC-log-only".
